# Design Decisions Report

## Project Overview
Provide a brief description of the project, its objectives, and key components.

## Design Decisions

### 1. HPC Settings
- **System Used:** Describe the High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment you utilized, such as the specifications of the cluster or cloud service, number of nodes, etc.
- **CPU and GPU Specifications:** Explain the CPU and GPU settings, including their configurations.
- **Memory Allocation:** Detail the memory allocation for the system.
- **Parallelization Techniques:** Discuss how parallelization was handled (e.g., threading, multiprocessing).
- **Optimization:** Describe any optimizations that were made (e.g., load balancing, resource allocation).

### 2. Architecture and Technologies
- **Framework/Tools Used:** Describe the main frameworks, tools, and technologies used during the project (e.g., libraries, frameworks, programming languages).
- **Why These Tools:** Explain why you chose the specific tools or frameworks. 
- **Alternative Approaches:** Discuss any alternative tools or frameworks that were considered and why they were ultimately not selected.

### 3. Performance Considerations
- **Speed and Efficiency:** Discuss the performance goals (e.g., processing speed, load time, etc.) and how your design decisions helped achieve these.
- **Resource Usage:** Detail any considerations made regarding resource usage (e.g., CPU usage, memory optimization).

### 4. Code Structure and Modularity
- **Code Organization:** Explain how the code is structured (e.g., modular components, file organization).
- **Separation of Concerns:** Discuss how you ensured clear separation of concerns (e.g., separating data handling from UI logic).
- **Reusability:** Describe the modularity of the code and how it allows for future extension or reuse.

### 5. Testing and Validation
- **Testing Frameworks:** Mention the testing frameworks or tools used.
- **Types of Tests:** Discuss the types of tests you conducted (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).
- **Test Results:** Provide any relevant test results or insights gained from testing.

### 6. User Experience (UX) Considerations
- **User Interface Design:** Discuss any decisions made regarding the user interface and how they contributed to the user experience.
- **Accessibility Features:** Mention any accessibility features added to the system.

## Challenges Faced
- **Technical Challenges:** Describe the technical challenges you encountered during the design and how you overcame them.
- **Decision-Making Process:** Discuss any difficult decisions you had to make and why you made them.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key design decisions and their impact on the project's success. Reflect on any lessons learned or areas for improvement in future projects.
